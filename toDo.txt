* Promise.all with await (providing a single catch)?
* Build Objects with getters and setters
* Error catching ... how much is enough?
  - validating passed properties
  - should I throw more errors?
  -

* Abstract my Model to a module
* Why FormData ... const form = new FormData(document.getElementById('uploader'))
